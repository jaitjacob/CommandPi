# Node.js setup
```sudo apt install nodejs```
To remove this at a later stage just go,
```sudo apt remove nodejs```
This command will remove the package and retain the configuration files. These may be of use to you if you intend to install the package again at a later point. If you donâ€™t want to save the configuration files for later use, then run the following:
```sudo apt purge nodejs```
This will uninstall the package and remove the configuration files associated with it.
